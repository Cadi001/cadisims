    <h4>🎯 Think Like a Computer</h4>
    <p><strong>Imagine you're a waiter taking orders at a restaurant.</strong> You follow the same steps every time: take the order, give it to the kitchen, serve the food, collect payment. A computer simulation works the same way - it follows the same steps over and over!</p>
    <p><strong>If you can do it step-by-step with paper and pencil, you can teach a computer to do it automatically.</strong></p>
</div>

<div class="real-world-box">
    <h5>🧠 Why Learn This?</h5>
    <p>Think of it like learning to drive. You could just jump in a self-driving car, but if you learn to drive manually first, you understand how cars really work. Hand simulation teaches you the "driving" of computer modeling!</p>
    <p><strong>Real benefit:</strong> When you use simulation software later, you'll know what's happening behind the scenes and can spot when something goes wrong.</p>

<!-- Random Numbers Section (Replace lines 277-280) -->
<div class="simple-explanation">
    <h4>🎲 Making Randomness Work for Us</h4>
    <p><strong>Real life is unpredictable!</strong> You never know exactly when the next customer will walk into a store, or how long they'll take to decide what to buy. We use random numbers (like rolling dice) to mimic this unpredictability in our simulations.</p>
    <p><strong>Think of it like this:</strong> Instead of guessing "customers arrive every 5 minutes," we say "customers arrive randomly between 1-10 minutes" and use dice to decide the exact time.</p>

<h4>Example: A Grocery Store's Daily Apple Sales</h4>

        <h5>How It Works - Step by Step</h5>
        <p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Put 10 pieces of paper numbered 0-9 in a hat.</p>
        <p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Draw one piece. If you get "7", look at the table - that means you'll sell 2 bags of apples today!</p>
        <p><strong>The Magic:</strong> Since 4 numbers (5,6,7,8) lead to "2 bags", you have a 40% chance of selling 2 bags - just like in real life!</p>
